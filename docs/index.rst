==========================================================

Clustering Geo-Data Cubes (CGC) is a Python tool to perform clustering
analysis for geo-spatial applications.

The code has been developed as a collaborative effort between the 
`ITC, University of Twente`_ and `the Netherlands eScience Center`_ 
within the generalization of the project `High spatial resolution phenological modelling at continental scales`_.
The code is hosted on `GitHub`_. If you want to contribute to the development of CGC,
have a look at the  `contribution guidelines`_.
